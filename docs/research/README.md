# Cross-service integration research

This directory holds the **Phase B research artifacts** for the cross-service
deps + diagrams project. The umbrella spec is at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-cross-service-deps-and-diagrams-design.md`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rows/<service>.md` | One per service doc folder under `docs/services/`. Captures the service's missing-pair integrations, candidate new services, and feature gaps. **One file = one author = one subagent run.** |
| `candidates/<slug>.md` | One per candidate new service (e.g. `obsidian-mcp.md`, `langfuse.md`). Multiple rows may reference the same candidate. |
| `integration-matrix.md` | Generated index that aggregates all rows by service, by category, plus a global candidates table. **Do not edit by hand.** Re-generate with `python -m bootstrapper.docs.merge_research`. |

## Row file schema

Each `rows/<service>.md` is a markdown file with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
service: <doc-folder-name>          # e.g. hermes, stt-provider
category: infra | data | llm | media | agents | apps
generated: YYYY-MM-DD
generator: phase-b-subagent | phase-b-controller | phase-b-hand-edit
sources_consulted:
  - <URL or local path>
  - ...
---
```

Followed by exactly three numbered sections:

1. `## 1. Missing-pair integrations` — pairs of EXISTING stack services that should be wired together but aren't yet. Each bullet must include: Why valuable, Mechanism sketch, Effort (small | medium | large), Risks / open questions, Confidence (high | medium | low).
2. `## 2. Candidate new services` — services NOT in the stack today that would slot in cleanly. Each bullet points at a full one-pager in `candidates/<slug>.md`. Each row file caps at **5 candidates**.
3. `## 3. Per-service feature gaps` — features the upstream project exposes that we don't yet leverage.

If a section has no findings, use the exact placeholder line:

```
_No high-confidence opportunities identified._
```

**Hard caps:**
- 800 words total per row file.
- 5 candidate cross-references per row file.

## Candidate one-pager schema

Each `candidates/<slug>.md`:

```yaml
---
slug: <kebab-case>
name: <Display Name>
type: external-service
category-fit: agents | data | media | infra | llm | apps
generated: YYYY-MM-DD
upstream: <URL>
license: <SPDX identifier or "unknown">
referenced-by: [<service>, ...]      # maintained by merge script, not by author
---
```

Six required sections:

1. `## Headline` — one sentence.
2. `## Problem it solves` — 2-3 sentences.
3. `## Stack wiring sketch` — bullets naming real services in the current topology.
4. `## Effort` — small / medium / large + one sentence.
5. `## Risks & open questions` — bullets (may be empty but heading is required).
6. `## Upstream evidence` — at least one URL backing the claim.

`## Why now (and why not sooner)` is optional.

## Validation

A schema validator lives at `scripts/validate_research_schema.py`. Run it on
one file or all:

```bash
python scripts/validate_research_schema.py docs/research/rows/hermes.md
python scripts/validate_research_schema.py --all
```

Exit 0 = valid, 1 = errors (printed with file:line refs).

## Merging

`python -m bootstrapper.docs.merge_research` reads all rows + candidates,
emits `integration-matrix.md`, and reconciles `referenced-by:` on each
candidate. Deterministic and idempotent.

## Dispatch pattern (how Phase B was produced)

21 parallel `Explore`-type subagents, one per doc folder, each given a
programmatically-generated prompt by `bootstrapper.docs.research_subagent_prompt.build_research_prompt(name)`.
WebFetch budget: 8 per subagent. Subagents write to their own row file
(no contention) and may create candidate one-pagers (collision-safe via
file-exists check + `## Cross-references` append).
