# Contributing — adding or modifying a service

The stack uses a **per-service folder layout** under `services/<name>/`. Each service family (one or more co-lifecycled containers) owns:

- `service.yml` — manifest: env vars, source variants, image refs, dependencies, plus per-source bootstrapper runtime data under `runtime_sc:` / `runtime_adaptive:` / `runtime_deps:`
- `compose.yml` — Docker Compose fragment for that family's containers
- optional subdirectories holding Dockerfiles, init scripts, source code, configuration files, snapshots, etc. — see the **Subdirectory naming convention** below

The thin top-level `docker-compose.yml` merges fragments via Compose's native `include:` directive (requires Compose ≥ v2.20; v2.26+ recommended).

## TL;DR — the 60-second checklist

A maintainer who already understands the stack can land a new service in under an hour by following this list. Each step links to the relevant deep-dive section.

- [ ] **Study the candidate service's upstream docs** (license, default port, API shape, runtime deps) → [Pre-flight](#pre-flight--study-the-candidate-service)
- [ ] **Pick a folder flavor** → [Decision 1](#decision-1--folder-flavor-container-virtual-or-doc-only)
- [ ] **Pick a category** → [Decision 2](#decision-2--category)
- [ ] **Pick your sources** → [Decision 3](#decision-3--source-variants)
- [ ] **Write `services/<name>/service.yml`** → [Mechanics](#mechanics--putting-it-all-together)
- [ ] **Write `services/<name>/compose.yml`** (only if folder flavor = container) → [Mechanics](#mechanics--putting-it-all-together)
- [ ] **Add the `include:` line to `docker-compose.yml`** (only if you wrote a compose fragment)
- [ ] **Register CLI key in `source_mapping`** → [Mechanics — source_override_manager registration](#bootstrapperutilssource_override_managerpy--register-the-cli-key). Without this the wizard silently skips your service.
- [ ] **Run the four-command regen + lint chain** → [After you save the files](#after-you-save-the-files--regen--lint-commands-in-order)
- [ ] **Update audit-script allowlists** if your service has hard deps → [Audit-script + CI implications](#audit-script--ci-implications)
- [ ] **Commit and push.** CI gates the change (three jobs: manifest-lint+pytest, compose-equivalence+permutation matrix, docs-drift+audit-scripts).

If you're new to this codebase, read Decisions 1–6 in sequence; the Qdrant worked example illustrates each one.

## The six decisions you have to make

| # | Decision | Default if you're unsure | Drill-down |
|---|----------|--------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Folder flavor | `container` | [Decision 1](#decision-1--folder-flavor-container-virtual-or-doc-only) |
| 2 | Category | the category of the service you're most similar to | [Decision 2](#decision-2--category) |
| 3 | Source variants | `container` + `disabled` (minimum); add `localhost` if users might run this themselves | [Decision 3](#decision-3--source-variants) |
| 4 | Port allocation | nothing — it's auto-assigned. Just declare `<NAME>_PORT` in the env block. | [Decision 4](#decision-4--port-allocation) |
| 5 | Dependencies | the manifest of the closest sibling in your category, to preserve display order | [Decision 5](#decision-5--dependencies-depends_onrequired--optional) |
| 6 | Adaptive / hooks | none — start with declarative `runtime_sc`, escalate to a Python helper only when YAML can't express it | [Decision 6](#decision-6--adaptive-behavior--when-to-write-a-hook) |

> **Worked example throughout:** Adding **Qdrant**, a self-hosted vector database. (Qdrant is real software but NOT currently in the stack — Weaviate is our vector DB. Used here purely as an instructional example, not a proposal.)

## Adding a new service

The full walkthrough is the six **Decision** sections below — they cover
folder flavor, category, source variants, port allocation, dependencies,
and adaptive behavior with a Qdrant-as-example thread running through.

If you already know the moving parts, the [TL;DR — 60-second checklist](#tldr--the-60-second-checklist)
condenses it to one block, and the canonical regen + lint chain lives at
[After you save the files](#after-you-save-the-files--regen--lint-commands-in-order)
(five commands, in this order — running fewer trips the byte-equivalence
test or docs-drift gate in CI).

> **First time adding a service?** Start with the [Pre-flight study](#pre-flight--study-the-candidate-service) below — it lists the upstream-doc questions whose answers feed every later decision.

## Pre-flight — study the candidate service

Before you touch any manifest, spend 15–30 minutes with the candidate service's upstream docs. The six decisions below all depend on facts you'll find there. The wrong answer to "what port does it listen on?" or "does it speak the OpenAI API?" cascades into a wrong category, wrong sources, wrong compose mapping, wrong Kong route — every later step.

### Research checklist — what to extract from upstream docs

| Question | Where to find it | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|
| One-line elevator pitch | Upstream README / project homepage | Drives `label:` in your manifest + the wizard prompt hint |
| Protocol exposed (REST/HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, custom binary) | Upstream API docs | Determines whether Kong can proxy it + which existing services can call it |
| OpenAI-API-compatible? | Upstream "API compatibility" docs | If yes → likely belongs behind LiteLLM. If no → direct integration. |
| Default in-container listen port(s) | Upstream `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose` example / `docker run` examples | Compose `ports: <host>:<container>` mapping (Decision 4) |
| Published container images (CPU/GPU/MLX, arch tags) | Docker Hub / GHCR / quay.io page | Decision 3 — which `container-*` source variants to offer |
| License | LICENSE file in upstream repo | Compatibility check. Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD-3 are fine; AGPL / SSPL / source-available licenses require explicit maintainer review before adoption. |
| Runtime dependencies (DB? cache? object store? files?) | Upstream "Configuration" / "Deployment" docs | Decision 5 — `depends_on.required` entries AND whether existing stack services can satisfy them (no need to add a fresh Postgres if Supabase Postgres works). |
| Healthcheck endpoint | Upstream `Dockerfile` `HEALTHCHECK` or operational docs | For the compose fragment's `healthcheck:` block |
| Managed cloud version available? | Upstream project website | Decide if `external` source variant is worth offering |
| Common host-install footprint (do users already run this themselves?) | Project ecosystem knowledge / Reddit / HN | Decide if `localhost` source variant is worth offering |
| Configuration style (env vars, mounted YAML, both) | Upstream "Configuration" docs | Drives `runtime_sc.<key>.environment` vs. `volumes:` mounts in compose |
| GPU passthrough required? | Upstream "Hardware requirements" / README | If yes → split `container-gpu` from `container-cpu`, set `runtime: nvidia` in compose |
| Persistent state (writes to disk vs. fully stateless) | Upstream "Storage" / "Persistence" docs | Determines whether you need a named volume in compose |

### Integration discovery — how does this fit our stack?

Once you understand the candidate, scan our existing 25-manifest stack to identify integration points:

- **Upstream callers (who in our stack would call this new service).** Run `grep -l "^data_flow:" services/*/service.yml` and skim each service's `data_flow.calls` list. Which existing services would benefit from calling this new one? (E.g., a new vector DB → Backend, n8n, JupyterHub, possibly Hermes Agent.) These become entries in those EXISTING manifests' `data_flow.calls` lists — NOT in your new service's `depends_on`. (See [Decision 5](#decision-5--dependencies-depends_onrequired--optional) for why `data_flow.calls` is separate from `depends_on`.)
- **Downstream callees (what this service calls).** Does the candidate make outbound calls to anything we already run? Most app-tier services touch Supabase (auth/storage), LiteLLM (LLM access), and Redis (caching). These would be entries in YOUR new service's `data_flow.calls`.
- **Source-variant precedents.** Find the closest existing service that ships similar source variants and use its manifest as a template:
  - New vector DB → `services/weaviate/service.yml`
  - New LLM gateway / engine → `services/litellm/`, `services/ollama/`
  - New STT/TTS engine → `services/parakeet/`, `services/speaches/`, plus the aggregator pattern in `services/stt-provider/` + `services/tts-provider/`
  - New app-tier UI → `services/open-webui/`, `services/jupyterhub/`
  - New cloud-API toggle (not a container) → `services/cloud-providers/service.yml`

### Worked example — Qdrant pre-flight

| Question | Qdrant answer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Elevator pitch | Open-source vector database with HTTP+gRPC APIs and built-in clustering. | qdrant.tech |
| Protocol | REST/HTTP on 6333, gRPC on 6334. | Qdrant API docs |
| OpenAI-compatible? | No — Qdrant has its own REST API. Backend would call it directly. | API reference |
| Default port | 6333 (HTTP). | Upstream `docker-compose.yml` |
| Container images | `qdrant/qdrant:vX.Y.Z` (Docker Hub). CPU-only public image; GPU support is built in but isn't a separate image tag. | hub.docker.com/r/qdrant/qdrant |
| License | Apache 2.0 ✓ | LICENSE file in repo |
| Runtime deps | Self-contained — writes its own storage to a mounted volume. No external DB or cache. | Qdrant "Storage" docs |
| Healthcheck | `GET /healthz` returns 200 when ready. | Qdrant operational docs |
| Managed cloud? | Yes — Qdrant Cloud. Worth offering `external`. | cloud.qdrant.io |
| Host install common? | Less common than Postgres/Weaviate for typical users; offer `localhost` for flexibility but expect rare use. | Ecosystem knowledge |
| Config style | Env vars (`QDRANT__SERVICE__GRPC_PORT`, …) + optional `config.yaml` volume mount. | Qdrant "Configuration" docs |
| GPU passthrough? | No. | — |
| Persistent state | Yes — writes to `/qdrant/storage` (mount a named volume). | Qdrant "Storage" docs |

**Integration discovery for Qdrant.** Backend and n8n already call Weaviate; Qdrant would be a sibling vector-DB option for users who prefer it. JupyterHub users running RAG experiments might want a second vector store for A/B comparisons. No service in our stack would be a downstream caller — Qdrant is a leaf vector store. → On Qdrant's manifest, `data_flow.calls: []`. Integration entries appear in `services/{backend,n8n,jupyterhub}/service.yml`'s `data_flow.calls` lists (added in those manifests, not in Qdrant's).

**Source-variant precedent.** Weaviate is the closest sibling — same category (`data`), same role (vector DB), similar source-variant shape. Open `services/weaviate/service.yml` side-by-side while drafting `services/qdrant/service.yml`.

With pre-flight complete, the six decisions become near-mechanical — proceed to [Decision 1](#decision-1--folder-flavor-container-virtual-or-doc-only).

## Decision 1 — Folder flavor: container, virtual, or doc-only

Three legitimate flavors of folder live under `services/`. Pick the right one before writing anything else.

| Flavor | `service.yml`? | `virtual: true`? | `compose.yml`? | Examples in this repo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Container service** | yes | absent / false | yes | most services — backend, supabase, ollama, weaviate, … |
| **Virtual manifest** | yes | `true` | no | `cloud-providers/` (LiteLLM-routed APIs), `globals/` (project + branding env), `tts-provider/` (engine selector) |
| **Doc-only folder** | no | n/a | no | `stt-provider/`, `doc-processor/`, `multi2vec-clip/` — aggregator docs + diagrams for a role whose engines live in sibling folders |

**Flowchart:**

1. Does it run as a container with its own image? → **container**.
2. Does it own env vars / `SOURCE` toggles but with no compose fragment of its own? → **virtual**. Set `virtual: true`; omit `compose.yml`. The validator enforces this.
3. Is it documentation-only — aggregating other manifests under one user-facing role? → **doc-only**. No `service.yml`, no `compose.yml`, just `README.md` + `architecture.svg` / `architecture.html`.

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Qdrant ships as a container image (`qdrant/qdrant:v1.12.0`), exposes a real HTTP API, and has its own env vars → **container flavor**.

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding a virtual manifest with a compose fragment — the schema validator will reject it. Either remove `compose.yml` (if no container runs) or unset `virtual: true` and keep the compose fragment (container flavor).
- Adding a doc-only folder when the role has env vars to manage — use a virtual manifest instead.

## Decision 2 — Category

Every manifest declares one of six categories. The category drives two things: the wizard block your row renders in, and the port-slot block your service draws from.

| Category | Wizard block | Services currently in this category | When to pick |
|---|---|---|---|
| `infra` | Infrastructure | Kong, globals | Gateways, project-wide config, observability |
| `data` | Data | Supabase, Redis, MinIO, Neo4j, Weaviate (+ `multi2vec-clip` as a Weaviate sub-module) | Databases, caches, object storage |
| `llm` | LLM Core | LiteLLM, Ollama, cloud-providers | LLM gateways / engines |
| `media` | Media | ComfyUI, parakeet, speaches, chatterbox, docling, searxng, tts-provider | Multimodal AI (image / audio / doc / search) |
| `agents` | Agents & Workflows | Hermes, n8n, openclaw | Programmable AI agents, workflow runners |
| `apps` | Apps & UIs | Backend, Open WebUI, JupyterHub, Local Deep Researcher | User-facing UIs |

**Effects of the category:**
- **Wizard placement.** Categories render in fixed order (`infra` → `data` → `llm` → `media` → `agents` → `apps`). Within a category, services follow topological order (driven by `depends_on.required`).
- **Port-slot block.** Each category gets its own port-offset range — see [Decision 4](#decision-4--port-allocation).
- **Architecture-diagram clustering.** The full-stack diagram at `docs/diagrams/architecture.svg` (hand-authored via the architecture-diagram skill) groups services by category band. Per-service architecture diagrams under `services/<name>/architecture.svg` use the same category palette but cluster the call graph instead.

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Qdrant is a vector database. Its closest siblings in the stack are Weaviate and Supabase (which are also `data`-tier). → **`category: data`**.

**How to pick when you're unsure:** find the most-similar existing service and use its category. If your service genuinely doesn't fit any of the six, that's a design conversation, not a category decision — open an issue first.

## Decision 3 — Source variants

Every user-configurable service has an `<SVC>_SOURCE` env var. The wizard reads its values from the `sources.options` block in your manifest.

**Standard option names** (use these; don't invent new ones unless your service genuinely needs them):

| Option | Meaning | When to offer it |
|---|---|---|
| `container` | Run as a Docker container alongside the stack | Always, for container-flavor services |
| `container-cpu` / `container-gpu` | Split when the container has CPU/GPU variants | When you publish a GPU variant of the image |
| `localhost` | Connect to a user-managed instance on the host | When users typically already have this software installed locally (e.g. Ollama, ComfyUI) |
| `external` | Connect to a remote URL | When users may point at a managed cloud version |
| `api` | Use a hosted cloud API (no container) | LLM gateways only |
| `disabled` | Excluded from compose entirely | Always — every optional service must support this |
| `<engine>-*` | Engine-specific sub-variants | For aggregator services that pick from multiple engines (STT/TTS) |

**Implications of your choices:**

- **Locked vs. user-choice.** A service with only one source variant is "locked" — the wizard skips its prompt entirely. The `_is_locked` helper in `bootstrapper/services/topology.py` enforces this. Services like Backend, Kong, LiteLLM are locked because they're always-on.
- **`requires:` per option.** Use `requires: [<ENV_VAR>]` on a source option to declare prerequisite env vars (e.g. `external` typically requires `<SVC>_EXTERNAL_URL`).
- **`<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT` as the single source of truth.** If you offer `localhost`, declare a `<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT` env var (integer string, defaulting to the upstream's standard host port). The URL is then derived at compose-render time and Kong-config-generation time as `http://host.docker.internal:${<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT:-<default>}`. Both the in-container consumers (`runtime_sc.<svc>.localhost.environment`) AND the Kong route generator (`bootstrapper/utils/kong_config_generator.py`) MUST read the same PORT var so the two paths agree on where the localhost upstream lives. The wizard surfaces an inline integer textbox on the `localhost` row so users can override it without editing `.env`. See [`docs/specs/2026-05-25-localhost-port-override-design.md`](specs/2026-05-25-localhost-port-override-design.md) §4.1 for the full design, and [Common gotchas](#common-gotchas--anti-patterns) for the symmetry rule.
- **`runtime_sc` slice per source.** Every source variant declared in `sources.options` should have a matching `runtime_sc.<key>.<source>` slice with `scale`, `environment`, `deploy`, `extra_hosts`. The manifest validator does NOT currently check coverage — a missing slice silently scales that source to 0 — so add a slice for every option you declare.

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Most users won't already run Qdrant locally, so `container` is the primary path. But we offer all four anyway for flexibility:
> - `container` — default, scale=1
> - `localhost` — `QDRANT_LOCALHOST_PORT` defaults to `"6333"` (Qdrant's standard host port); the URL is derived at compose-render time as `http://host.docker.internal:6333`
> - `external` — `requires: [QDRANT_EXTERNAL_URL]`
> - `disabled` — scale=0

## Decision 4 — Port allocation

**The bootstrapper auto-assigns ports. You do not pick a port.**

**How it works:**
- `BASE_PORT` (default `63000`) is the bottom of the port range. Users can override with `./start.sh --base-port 64000`.
- `CATEGORY_SLOTS` in `bootstrapper/services/topology.py` assigns each category an `(offset, block_size)` tuple. Current values (accurate as of 2026-05-24):

  | Category | Offset | Block size | Resolved range with default `BASE_PORT=63000` |
  |---|---:|---:|---|
  | `infra` | 0 | 10 | 63000-63009 |
  | `data` | 10 | 20 | 63010-63029 |
  | `llm` | 30 | 10 | 63030-63039 |
  | `media` | 40 | 20 | 63040-63059 |
  | `agents` | 60 | 20 | 63060-63079 |
  | `apps` | 80 | 20 | 63080-63099 |

- Within each category block, services consume slots in **topological order** (driven by `depends_on.required` — see Decision 5). Multi-port services (e.g. Supabase's 8 containers, Weaviate's HTTP + gRPC pair, MinIO's API + Console pair) get a contiguous run.
- A category-overflow lint trips if you blow past your block. Fixes: move manifests to a different category (rare), or extend the block size in `CATEGORY_SLOTS` (also rare — coordinate with maintainers).

**How to declare a port:**

In your `env:` block, declare `name: <SVC>_PORT` with NO `default:` line. Convention is a single-line comment:

```yaml
env:
  - name: QDRANT_PORT
    # default removed — computed by services/topology.py slot allocator
```

The `services/env_assembler.py` regen step emits the resolved port into `.env.example`. Never hand-edit `.env.example` — it's a generated artifact (byte-equivalence-tested in CI).

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Qdrant declares `QDRANT_PORT` with no default. Topology slots it into the `data` block at the next free offset, determined by where it lands in the topo sort relative to its siblings (Supabase microservices, Redis, MinIO, Neo4j, Weaviate). The exact number is auto-resolved at every regen — don't pin it.

## Decision 5 — Dependencies (`depends_on.required` / `optional`)

This is the most nuanced decision. The field `depends_on.required` in `service.yml` has **two semantics that get conflated**:

**Runtime semantics (intended):** "These services must be up before this one boots." Maps to the corresponding `depends_on:` block in your `compose.yml` fragment.

**Display-ordering semantics (overloaded):** The bootstrapper uses `depends_on.required` as the canonical-order backbone for the wizard's row order and the overview-box display. Within a category, services sort topologically; an edge from A → B means A appears AFTER B in the same category's wizard block.

### Why this matters — the footgun

Kong's manifest used to list 19 services in `required` because Kong **proxies** to them — but Kong doesn't need them to **boot** (only Supabase + Redis). Trimming the list to its real boot dependencies was correct.

But trimming `litellm` from `ollama.depends_on.required` correctly removed a fake runtime edge — and broke a UI ordering test (`test_row_order_stability.py`), because `ollama` was relying on that edge to pin its position in the wizard's LLM block. Removing it shifted port slots throughout the LLM and media blocks.

### Current convention (codified in manifest comments in commit `d98bc5a`)

- Use `required` for **genuine bootstrap blockers** AND for **cross-category display-ordering pins**.
- Comment any non-runtime edge inline as a display-ordering pin so readers don't try to "fix" it. Example from `services/ollama/service.yml`:

  ```yaml
  depends_on:
    # `litellm` is listed here NOT because the ollama container calls
    # LiteLLM (the call direction is the opposite), but because the
    # bootstrapper uses `depends_on.required` as the canonical-order
    # backbone for the wizard / overview-box display. […]
    required:
      - supabase
      - litellm
  ```

- A future schema change may add a separate `display_order:` field that takes over the ordering job; until then, comment the intent.

### Things to avoid

- **Don't** list every service you *call* in `required`. Use `data_flow.calls` for that (it drives the architecture diagram and the per-service README's Dependencies & Integrations block — not topology).
- **Don't** depend on virtual aggregates (`globals`, `cloud-providers`) in `required`. They have no runtime presence; the audit removed phantom `globals` edges from `supabase` and `docling`.
- **Don't** list `optional` deps that compose doesn't enforce. The `optional` list is documentation; if compose doesn't gate on it, it has no effect.
- **Don't** list a depends-on for a service that's source-replaceable (`localhost`, `external`, `disabled`). The audit script `scripts/check-compose-source-deps.py` enforces this; SOURCE-replaceable consumers should reach their target via endpoint env vars + runtime readiness checks, not via compose `depends_on`.

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Qdrant's only data-tier sibling that always runs is Supabase (the substrate the bootstrapper provisions before any other service starts). Listing it as a required dep pins Qdrant's position in the data block topologically. → `required: [supabase]`, `optional: []`.

### `data_flow.calls` is separate

The `data_flow.calls` field is a runtime call graph that drives the architecture diagram and the per-service README's Dependencies & Integrations block. It is **independent** of `depends_on`. Use it to describe which services this one calls at runtime in the request path (excluding init-time bootstrap calls).

## Decision 6 — Adaptive behavior + when to write a hook

Most services express their per-source behavior with declarative `runtime_sc` YAML. The synthesizer in `bootstrapper/services/sc_synthesizer.py` concatenates all manifests' `runtime_sc` slices into the runtime service-config dict the bootstrapper consumes.

**Declarative example** (suffices for ~90% of services):

```yaml
runtime_sc:
  qdrant:
    container:
      scale: 1
      environment:
        QDRANT_LOG_LEVEL: info
      deploy: {}
      extra_hosts: []
    localhost:
      scale: 0
      environment:
        QDRANT_ENDPOINT: http://host.docker.internal:${QDRANT_LOCALHOST_PORT:-6333}
      deploy: {}
      extra_hosts:
        - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
    disabled:
      scale: 0
      environment: {}
      deploy: {}
      extra_hosts: []
```

### When you need a `_generate_<svc>_config()` Python helper

Write a helper in `bootstrapper/services/service_config.py` and wire it into `generate_service_environment()` ONLY when one of these is true:

1. **Multi-input SOURCE dependencies.** Your output depends on more than one `<SVC>_SOURCE` value. Example: `_generate_stt_provider_config` and `_generate_tts_provider_config` cooperate via a `shared_env` dict — STT runs first and writes `SPEACHES_SCALE`; TTS reads STT's output and avoids double-scheduling Speaches when both roles pick a Speaches variant.
2. **Derived / aggregated state.** You need to compute env vars from a set of toggles. Example: `_generate_cloud_providers_config` reads three `CLOUD_*_SOURCE` toggles + their API keys and emits `LITELLM_ENABLED_PROVIDERS` as a comma-separated string.
3. **Runtime-computed values.** You need an env var whose value depends on another service's port, computed at runtime from `BASE_PORT`.

For everything else, stay declarative. Adding a hook means writing Python, adding a unit test for it, and giving future maintainers an extra place to read.

> **Worked example — Qdrant:** Single SOURCE, no cross-service dependencies, no derived state. → **No hook needed.** The declarative `runtime_sc` covers all four sources.

### `runtime_adaptive` and `runtime_deps`

Two adjacent fields that occasionally apply:

- **`runtime_adaptive`** — for services like `backend` that adapt their behavior based on which upstream services are enabled. Declares `adapts_to:` (a list of provider keys) and `environment_adaptation:` (env vars conditionally set when those providers are active). See `services/backend/service.yml` for the reference pattern.
- **`runtime_deps`** — declares optional runtime dependencies (services this one calls only if they're enabled). Drives the info-message shown to the user during the wizard.

Use these only if your service is genuinely adaptive. Today seven manifests declare `runtime_adaptive` (backend, comfyui, hermes, jupyterhub, n8n, ollama, weaviate); backend is the most heavily adaptive and the canonical reference. Don't reach for these fields by default — start with declarative `runtime_sc` and only escalate when the adaptive behavior is non-trivial.

## Mechanics — putting it all together

After making the six decisions, you write two files. Here's the full result for Qdrant. Line callouts (`# ← Decision N`) point back to the decision section that explains the choice.

### `docker-compose.yml` — one new include line

Add to the top-level `include:` block in the `# Data tier` section:

```yaml
  # Data tier
  - services/supabase/compose.yml
  - services/redis/compose.yml
  - services/minio/compose.yml
  - services/neo4j/compose.yml
  - services/qdrant/compose.yml              # ← new
```

### `bootstrapper/utils/source_override_manager.py` — register the CLI key

This is a **mandatory registration step** that's easy to forget. `SourceOverrideManager.source_mapping` is a hardcoded dict; the wizard's `ServiceDiscovery.discover()` filters every service through it. **A service NOT in this mapping is silently dropped from the wizard** — the user never sees a prompt for it.

For a single-container family (most services), add ONE entry:

```python
self.source_mapping = {
    # … existing entries …
    'qdrant_source': 'QDRANT_SOURCE',          # ← new
}
```

For a multi-container family (head + worker, or app + init), the runtime_sc top-level key drives discovery. Map the "main" container's `<key>_source` to the family's actual env var. Example: Ray has `ray-head` and `ray-worker` containers in runtime_sc but a single `RAY_SOURCE` env var — so the mapping is `'ray_head_source': 'RAY_SOURCE'` (the worker has no entry → filtered out, mirroring how `comfyui-init` / `hermes-init` are skipped).

The CLI flag binding in `bootstrapper/start.py` (`@click.option('--qdrant-source', …)` + the `source_args` dict) uses the family-level `qdrant_source` key — different from the discovery key for multi-container families. If your service is multi-container, you'll have TWO entries in `source_mapping` pointing to the SAME env var (one for CLI plumbing, one for discovery).

The pinning test `bootstrapper/tests/test_wizard_app_discovery.py::test_source_mapping_includes_app_service_flags` enforces this — add your service's CLI key to the assertion list so future regressions fail loudly.

## After you save the files — regen + lint commands in order

Five commands, in this order:

```bash
cd bootstrapper

# 1. Regenerate .env.example from manifests
uv run python -m services.env_assembler

# 2. Regenerate README.md TOPOLOGY block (auto-includes the new row)
uv run python -m tools.generate_readme_topology

# 3. (top-level architecture diagram — hand-authored; no regen step)
#    Update docs/diagrams/architecture.svg by hand via the
#    architecture-diagram skill if your service materially changes the
#    full-stack topology (new category band, new always-on tier, etc.).

# 4. Lint — fails if any of steps 1-3 were skipped
uv run python -m tools.validate_fragments

# 5. (Optional, recommended for new manifests) Regen per-service README + diagram
PYTHONPATH=. uv run python -m docs.regen qdrant
# After this, services/qdrant/{README.md, architecture.svg, architecture.html} exist.
```

**When to re-run each step:**

- **`env_assembler`** — after any change to a manifest's `env:` block, port allocation, or source variants.
- **`generate_readme_topology`** — after any change to a manifest's `rows:`, `display_name`, `category`, or `alias`.
- **Top-level `docs/diagrams/architecture.svg`** — hand-authored; touch ONLY when a service is added/removed at the band-level (new category, new gateway, etc.). Routine `data_flow.calls` edits flow into per-service diagrams via `bootstrapper.docs.regen`.
- **`validate_fragments`** — always, as the final check before committing.
- **`docs.regen`** — only after creating a new service, or after editing `data_flow.calls` on an existing service. The drift gate in CI (`bootstrapper.docs.regen --all --check`) catches stale per-service READMEs/SVGs/HTMLs.

**No external prerequisites.** Graphviz used to be required for the top-level diagram regen; that step is retired now that the diagram is hand-authored via the architecture-diagram skill.

## Audit-script + CI implications

After adding a service, check these allowlists. Skipping them means CI fails on the next push.

### `scripts/check-compose-source-deps.py` — two allowlists

- **`REQUIRED_DEPENDS_ON`** — set of `(service, dependency)` tuples that MUST appear in compose `depends_on`. Add entries here if your compose fragment hard-depends on `litellm`, `redis`, `supabase-db`, `weaviate-init`, etc. The script fails CI if your manifest claims a hard dep that compose doesn't enforce, OR vice versa.
- **`FORBIDDEN_OPTIONAL_DEPENDS_ON`** — set of edges that MUST NOT exist (depending on a SOURCE-replaceable service via `depends_on` is unsafe because that service may not run as a container). Add entries here if you have an intentional exception with documented justification.

### `scripts/check-kong-routes.py` — baseline-default audit

The script runs the Kong route generator against `.env.example` defaults (in a tmp working dir) and verifies the resulting routes match a hardcoded `EXPECTED_HOST_ROUTES` table at the top of the script. If your service publishes a `*.localhost` alias AND its source variant is on-by-default (i.e. `<SVC>_SOURCE`'s default value renders a route), add an entry to `EXPECTED_HOST_ROUTES` mapping the host to the expected upstream URL. Services that are off by default need no entry.

### `.github/dependabot.yml` — `directories:` list

If your service ships a `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` in a `build/` or `provider/` subdirectory, add the path to the `directories:` list of the `pip` ecosystem block. **Memory note:** all active manifests must be enumerated; omitted paths drop from scan coverage and silent vulnerabilities accumulate.

### CI gates that run on every push

The `.github/workflows/services-lint.yml` workflow has three jobs:

| Job | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **Manifest lint + unit tests** | `validate_fragments` lint + 390+ pytest tests. Catches: manifest schema violations, dependency cycles, env-example drift, category overflow. |
| **Compose merge + byte-equivalence + source-permutation matrix** | Renders `docker compose config` for the merged fragment list + verifies it matches the golden baseline + tests every source variant of every service. Catches: compose-syntax errors, source-permutation regressions. |
| **Docs drift + audit scripts** | `regen --all --check` + the 5 audit scripts (`check_doc_links`, `check-compose-source-deps`, `check-docs-drift`, `check-kong-routes`, `validate_research_schema`). Catches: stale per-service docs, missing `REQUIRED_DEPENDS_ON` entries, Kong route default drift, broken markdown links, research-schema violations. |

Run the equivalent of all three locally before pushing:

```bash
cd bootstrapper && uv run pytest -q                                    # job 1 + 2 (minus byte-equivalence)
cd bootstrapper && uv run python -m tools.validate_fragments           # job 1 lint
cp .env.example .env && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config -q # job 2 merge check
cd .. && PYTHONPATH=bootstrapper uv run --project bootstrapper python -m bootstrapper.docs.regen --all --check  # job 3 docs drift
python scripts/check_doc_links.py                                      # job 3 link check
python scripts/check-compose-source-deps.py                            # job 3 deps audit
python scripts/check-docs-drift.py                                     # job 3 docs structural audit
python scripts/check-kong-routes.py                                    # job 3 kong audit
python scripts/validate_research_schema.py --all                       # job 3 research schema
```

## Common gotchas + anti-patterns

Distilled from real audit findings — each entry cites the commit, PR, or memory note it came from.

### Dependency-list gotchas

- **Cross-category `depends_on.required` is a display-order pin.** Removing `litellm` from `ollama.required` is correct from a runtime POV but shifts the wizard's row order in the llm block (and transitively can affect media services like ComfyUI that chain through ollama). Keep cross-category edges and document the intent inline. See commit `d98bc5a`.
- **Don't depend on virtual aggregates in `required`.** `globals`, `cloud-providers`, `tts-provider` are virtual — no container, no compose. Depending on them adds a phantom node to the topo sort. The audit removed phantom `globals` edges from `supabase` and `docling`.
- **Compose-only deps vs. manifest deps must align both ways.** Kong's manifest used to list 19 proxy targets in `required` but compose only had 5 (truly correct — over-claimed). Backend's manifest only listed `[supabase, redis]` but compose waited for `litellm` health (under-claimed). The audit corrected both; `scripts/check-compose-source-deps.py` now catches missing edges.

### URL / localhost handling

- **`<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT` is the single source of truth.** Per PR #10 (see [`docs/specs/2026-05-25-localhost-port-override-design.md`](specs/2026-05-25-localhost-port-override-design.md)), localhost variants no longer carry a `<SVC>_LOCALHOST_URL` env var. Declare an integer-valued `<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT` instead and let every consumer derive the URL inline: `http://host.docker.internal:${<SVC>_LOCALHOST_PORT:-<default>}`. The same PORT var must be read by the in-container consumer (`runtime_sc.<svc>.localhost.environment`), the Kong route generator (`bootstrapper/utils/kong_config_generator.py`), and the wizard's inline-input widget (`rows[].localhost_port_var`). Asymmetric reads (e.g. Kong reads PORT but the consumer reads a hard-coded URL) silently let the two paths disagree about where the localhost upstream lives — `memory: feedback_localhost_url_override_symmetry`.
- **Kong routes fronting browser SPAs need `preserve_host: True`.** Without it the SPA emits unreachable redirect URLs containing the internal Docker hostname.

### Init-container patterns

- **Init containers use vanilla `alpine:latest` + inline `apk add`.** Don't ship a Dockerfile that builds a custom init image — the global `alpine:latest` tag gets clobbered.
- **TTS/STT engine in-container ports are NOT all 8000.** Parakeet, Speaches, Docling listen on `8000`; Chatterbox listens on `4123`. Don't assume.

### Regen / test gotchas

- **`.env.example` is byte-equivalence-tested.** After any manifest change affecting env vars or port allocation, regen `.env.example` or `test_env_example_consistency` will fail CI.
- **`test_fragment_equivalence` is sensitive to Compose-version defaults.** Don't regenerate the golden baseline reflexively when this test fails. Extend `_strip_volatile_defaults` in the test fixture instead.
- **`docker compose config` needs `.env` to render properly.** In CI, the audit-scripts job copies `.env.example` to `.env` before running the source-deps audit. Locally, you have a real `.env` so this is invisible — but if you remove your `.env`, the audit script's fallback to raw parsing of the top-level `docker-compose.yml` (which is an `include:`-only shell) produces spurious "missing required core dependency" failures.

### Topology / category gotchas

- **A new service in a near-full category block can trip the category-overflow lint.** `data` and `media` blocks are 20 slots each but Supabase alone uses 7. Check current utilization before assuming there's room.
- **Renaming a `row.display_name` breaks tests that hardcode it.** `test_wizard_app_discovery.py` has an `EXPECTED_DISCOVERED` frozenset; update it when renaming.

### Wizard discovery gotchas

- **A service missing from `SourceOverrideManager.source_mapping` is silently dropped from the wizard.** The wizard's `ServiceDiscovery.discover()` filters every service through the mapping — anything whose `<runtime_sc_key>_source` isn't a mapping key gets skipped without warning. Symptom: the user runs `./start.sh`, picks a base port, and the wizard jumps right past your new service. Fix: register the entry as described in [Mechanics — source_override_manager registration](#bootstrapperutilssource_override_managerpy--register-the-cli-key). The pinning test in `test_wizard_app_discovery.py::test_source_mapping_includes_app_service_flags` enforces this — add your CLI key to its assertion list. (This bit Ray in commit `2d027b9`; the runbook didn't flag the registration step before.)
- **Multi-container families need TWO source_mapping entries.** One for CLI flag plumbing (the family-level `<name>_source`), one for ServiceDiscovery to find the runtime_sc top-level key (the head container's `<head>_source`). Both point to the same env var. See the Ray example in `bootstrapper/utils/source_override_manager.py`.

## Subdirectory naming convention

Each service folder can hold additional subdirectories beyond `service.yml` and `compose.yml`. Use these well-known names so navigation stays predictable across the stack:

| Subdir | Holds | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `app/` | Source code for an app the manifest builds (the manifest's primary container is **this** code) | `services/backend/app/` (FastAPI source) |
| `build/` | Dockerfile + build inputs when the manifest builds a container from scratch | `services/jupyterhub/build/`, `services/neo4j/build/`, `services/local-deep-researcher/build/` |
| `init/` | Scripts + templates bind-mounted into a `<service>-init` sidecar container that prepares state before the main container starts | `services/n8n/init/`, `services/hermes/init/`, `services/comfyui/init/`, `services/minio/init/`, `services/weaviate/init/` |
| `catalog-init/` | Same as `init/` but for a *second* init sidecar that runs in a different tier (used by litellm only) | `services/litellm/catalog-init/` |
| `pull/` | Same as `init/` but the sidecar is named `<service>-pull` (only ollama) | `services/ollama/pull/` |
| `config/` | Read-only configuration files bind-mounted into the main container at runtime | `services/searxng/config/` (settings.yml) |
| `db/` | Database snapshots + SQL migration scripts | `services/supabase/db/` (snapshot/ + scripts/) |
| `provider/` | Multiple host/container providers for a single capability the manifest exposes via a SOURCE variable (one engine = one subfolder of `provider/`) | `services/parakeet/provider/{gpu,mlx,whisper-cpp,shared}`, `services/docling/provider/{gpu,localhost,shared}`, `services/tts-provider/provider/localhost` |
| `extras/` | User-managed bind-mounted data exposed inside the running container (tools, functions, workflows you can edit on the host) | `services/open-webui/extras/{tools,functions,workflows}` |
| `workflows-stage/` | Workflow JSON the init sidecar imports into the main container's DB on startup | `services/n8n/workflows-stage/` |

**Family folders.** Some manifests own a family of related containers (e.g. supabase = 8 containers, n8n = main + worker + init). Each family folder gets a brief `README.md` listing the containers it ships and pointing at their definition in `compose.yml`. The fragment's `services:` keys are the authoritative container list; the manifest's `containers:` must match 1:1 (the manifest_validator enforces this — see "Validator rules" below).

## Modifying an existing service

- Env var default change → edit the manifest's `env:` block. Re-run the lint.
- Image version bump → edit the manifest's `images[].default`. The compose fragment references the var, so no compose change is needed.
- New container in the family → add to `containers:` in the manifest AND to `services:` in the fragment.
- New source variant → add to `sources.options[]` in the manifest.

### Common modification flows

Short walk-throughs for the modifications you'll do most often:

- **Add a new source variant to an existing service.** Edit `sources.options` + `runtime_sc.<key>` to include the new source. Regen `.env.example`. The source-permutation matrix in CI will exercise every variant — make sure your new variant has a valid `runtime_sc` slice.
- **Rename a service's display name (`rows[].display_name`).** Update the row, then regen the README topology block. Search the test suite for the old name — `bootstrapper/tests/test_wizard_app_discovery.py::EXPECTED_DISCOVERED` is the most common dependency.
- **Bump a container image version.** Edit `images[].default` only. The compose fragment uses `${X_IMAGE}` interpolation, so nothing else changes. Don't forget to test the new image locally before committing.
- **Split a service family into multiple manifests.** Non-trivial. The supabase manifest (8 containers in one family) is the reference pattern; consult it before splitting.

## Cross-referencing sections in service READMEs

Service READMEs follow a numbered convention (`## 1. Overview`, `## 2. Access`, …). The "Dependencies & Integrations" block sits at whatever section number N the README's structure places it — typically 5, but 7/9/12/14 in READMEs with extra pre-Deps content. The `bootstrapper/docs/regen.py` tool detects N and emits matching subsection numbering (`### N.1` through `### N.6`) inside the block.

**Never link to a sub-section by number across services.** "See section 5.4 in the backend README" breaks the moment the target README adds a new pre-Deps section and shifts to 6.4. Always reference by heading text instead: "See *Future — Missing pair integrations* in the backend README."

## Schema cheatsheet

## Validator rules (what the lint catches)

1. **schema check** — every `service.yml` matches `bootstrapper/schemas/service.schema.json`
2. **duplicate_env_var** — exactly one manifest owns each env-var name
3. **duplicate_container** — exactly one manifest owns each container name
4. **unknown_dependency** — `depends_on.required/optional` references a known manifest
5. **undeclared_export** — every `exports[].name` is declared in `env:` OR written by some `runtime_sc.<key>.<source>.environment`
6. **undeclared_source_var** — the SOURCE var itself is declared in `env:`
7. **unknown_consumer** — every `exports[].consumers` entry is a known manifest

## Byte-equivalence

`bootstrapper/tests/test_fragment_equivalence.py` asserts that
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config` matches the golden baseline at
`bootstrapper/tests/fixtures/rendered_config_baseline.yml`. If you change a
fragment's compose shape, you'll either need to update the baseline (after
confirming the change is intentional) or restore byte-equivalence.

```bash
# Inspect drift
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml config > /tmp/actual.yml
diff bootstrapper/tests/fixtures/rendered_config_baseline.yml /tmp/actual.yml

# Refresh baseline (only when the drift is intentional)
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml config > \
    bootstrapper/tests/fixtures/rendered_config_baseline.yml
```


## `services/_user/` overlay slot (downstream submodule consumers)

Downstream forks that consume this repo as a git submodule may want to layer
additional services without modifying the upstream tree. Drop them under
`services/_user/<name>/`:

```
services/
├── _user/                    # gitignored upstream; tracked downstream
│   └── my-extra-service/
│       ├── service.yml
│       └── compose.yml
├── supabase/
├── ollama/
└── …
```

The default manifest loader (`bootstrapper.services.manifests.load_manifests`)
skips directories whose name starts with `_`, so `_user/` is invisible to the
core stack. A downstream `start.sh` wrapper can call
`load_manifests(services_dir / "_user")` and merge the results into its own
runtime — the manifest schema and the synthesizer are the same.

This slot is reserved by convention; the upstream `.gitignore` excludes
`services/_user/` so the directory never leaks into a fork's PRs.


## Documentation-only manifest fields

A few fields on `service.yml` are accepted by the schema but not yet consumed
by any operational code. They exist for clarity and future use:

- `images[].notes` — free-form note on what the image is used for. Not read
  by any Python code.
- `docs:` — pointer to the service's `services/<name>/README.md`. Useful
  for grep, but no Python imports it.
- `exports[]` — declares the env-var contract this service offers to other
  services. The cross-manifest validator (`bootstrapper/services/manifest_validator.py`)
  checks closure (every consumer name resolves) but does NOT check that the
  exported value is actually produced at runtime.

Treat these as documentation. Setting them helps future readers; omitting
them never breaks anything.
