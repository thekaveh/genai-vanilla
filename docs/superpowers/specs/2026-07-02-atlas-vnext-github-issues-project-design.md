# Atlas vNext GitHub Issues And Project Design

## 1. Goal

Turn the Atlas vNext strategy report into a durable GitHub planning system so the work is not lost after the report is read once.

The GitHub system should:

- Create one actionable GitHub issue per Build Now work item.
- Create epic issues for the larger themes named by the user and the downstream lakehouse handoff: Atlas Root Dashboard, MCP Package, Observability, Ingestion, Async Jobs, and Data Engineering Lakehouse Enablement.
- Capture Build Next, Build Later, watchlist, and deferred/rejected candidates as backlog or decision issues so they remain searchable and intentionally triaged.
- Use a GitHub Project as the prioritization board over the issues.
- Keep the active working surface focused on Build Now while preserving every vNext candidate, watchlist item, and explicit defer/reject decision from the report.

Primary source:

- [Atlas vNext Strategy Report](../../strategy/atlas-vnext-strategy-report.md)

## 2. Operating Model

Use a two-layer model:

1. **Complete capture:** every candidate or explicit roadmap decision in the report becomes a GitHub issue.
2. **Phased activation:** only Build Now implementation issues and their epics enter the active Project lanes immediately.

This avoids the two failure modes:

- Important ideas disappearing into a Markdown report that nobody revisits.
- The Project board becoming noisy with 40+ items that are not ready to build.

## 3. Project

Create one GitHub Project:

- **Title:** `Atlas vNext Roadmap`
- **Owner:** `thekaveh`
- **Repository:** `thekaveh/atlas`
- **Purpose:** prioritize, sequence, and track the vNext issue set derived from the strategy report.

Suggested views:

- **Roadmap Board:** grouped by `Roadmap Status`.
- **Wave Planning:** grouped by `Wave`.
- **Track Planning:** grouped by `Track`.
- **Risk Review:** grouped by `Risk`.
- **Epic View:** filtered to `type:epic`.

Suggested Project fields:

| Field | Type | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap Status | Single select | `Build Now`, `Ready`, `Backlog`, `Watchlist`, `Deferred`, `Rejected For Now`, `Blocked`, `Done` |
| Wave | Single select | `Build Now`, `Build Next`, `Build Later`, `Watchlist`, `Deferred`, `Rejected For Now`, `Already Shipped` |
| Track | Single select | `platform`, `mcp`, `observability`, `rag`, `async-jobs`, `data-eng`, `data-ml`, `identity-security`, `creative-3d`, `trading`, `voice`, `infra`, `decision` |
| Effort | Single select | `small`, `medium`, `large`, `unknown` |
| Risk | Single select | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `unknown` |
| Priority | Single select | `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3` |
| Type | Single select | `epic`, `implementation`, `evaluation`, `decision`, `watchlist` |
| Source | Text | Link to the report section and candidate research doc where applicable |

Initial Project status rules:

- Epic issues: Roadmap Status `Build Now`
- Build Now implementation issues: Roadmap Status `Build Now`
- Build Next issues: Roadmap Status `Backlog`
- Build Later issues: Roadmap Status `Backlog`
- Watchlist issues: Roadmap Status `Watchlist`
- Deferred decisions: Roadmap Status `Deferred`
- Rejected-for-now decisions: Roadmap Status `Rejected For Now`
- Already-shipped notes: Roadmap Status `Done` or omitted from the board unless an issue is needed for traceability

## 4. Labels

## 5. Standard Issue Body Template

Use this structure for implementation, evaluation, and watchlist issues:

```markdown
## Summary

<One paragraph describing what this issue should accomplish.>

## Source

- Report: <link to exact section>
- Candidate note: <link if one exists>

## Why

<Why this matters for Atlas, based on the report.>

## Scope

- <Concrete work item>
- <Concrete work item>

## Out Of Scope

- <Explicit non-goal>
- <Explicit non-goal>

## Dependencies

- <Existing Atlas service or prerequisite issue>

## Service Admission Contract

Complete this section for every issue that adds a new service, changes a service's runtime role, or materially changes how a service participates in Atlas' graph.

- Service category: `infra`, `data`, `llm`, `media`, `agents`, or `apps`
- Track membership: existing track keys and any proposed new track key
- SOURCE values: user-selectable values, default value, and whether a CLI flag is required
- Setup wizard: where the prompt appears, prompt copy, option copy, and track-skip behavior
- Port/topology: `bootstrapper/services/topology.py` row, port slot, aliases, and internal-only ports
- Kong exposure: route alias, direct port, internal-only posture, or no route
- Upstream dependencies: required and optional services this service calls
- Downstream consumers: services expected to call or link to this service
- Manifest/data-flow: `services/<name>/service.yml`, `runtime_sc`, `runtime_deps`, and `data_flow.calls`
- Docs/diagrams: service README, regenerated Dependencies & Integrations section, `architecture.svg`, and `architecture.html`
- Validation: manifest lint, docs drift, compose/source-dependency checks, route checks, and targeted tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <Verifiable outcome>
- [ ] <Verifiable outcome>
- [ ] <Docs/tests/validation outcome>

## Validation

```

Use this structure for deferred/rejected decision issues:

```markdown

## Source

- Report: <link to exact section>

## Why Not Now

<Reason from the report.>

## Revisit Criteria

- [ ] <Condition that would justify reopening>

- [ ] Spark Connect default config includes the `lakehouse` REST catalog pointed at `http://iceberg-rest:8181` and MinIO S3 path-style settings.
- [ ] `spark.sql("SHOW NAMESPACES IN lakehouse")` works from Spark Connect when `iceberg-rest` is enabled.
- [ ] `CREATE TABLE lakehouse.bronze.t (...) USING iceberg` writes metadata under the `lakehouse` bucket.

## 12. Creation Order

1. Create labels.
2. Create the Project.
3. Create epic issues.
4. Create Build Now implementation issues and link them to epics.
5. Create Build Next and Build Later backlog issues.
6. Create watchlist and deferred/rejected decision issues.
7. Add all issues to the Project.
8. Set Project fields according to wave, track, effort, risk, type, and priority.
9. Verify issue count and Project coverage against this spec.

Expected issue count:

- 6 epic issues
- 9 Build Now issues
- 12 Build Next issues
- 5 Build Later issues
- 10 watchlist issues
- 13 deferred/rejected/already-shipped decision issues
- **55 total issues**

## 13. Verification

Before considering the ticketing pass complete:

- [ ] `gh label list --limit 200` shows all required labels.
- [ ] `gh project list --owner thekaveh --format json` shows `Atlas vNext Roadmap`.
- [ ] `gh issue list --label vnext --limit 200` shows the expected issue count.
- [ ] Each Build Now issue has a report link, acceptance criteria, and at least one epic label where applicable.
- [ ] Every issue that adds a service or materially changes a service role includes a completed Service Admission Contract.
- [ ] All Build Now issues are in Project Roadmap Status `Build Now`.
- [ ] Deferred/rejected issues are not in Roadmap Status `Build Now`.
- [ ] `python scripts/check_doc_links.py` passes after this spec is committed.

## 14. Open Decisions

- Whether to use GitHub's sub-issues UI if available for the repository, or rely on issue body links and labels for epic relationships.
- Whether to create all 55 issues in one scripted pass or create epics plus Build Now manually first, then bulk-create the rest.
- Whether to keep the existing `LinguAI Kanban` project separate or migrate any relevant Atlas items from it later. The vNext board should be separate by default.
