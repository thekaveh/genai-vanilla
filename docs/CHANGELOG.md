## Migration Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0 (Python Migration)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Update start/stop usage**: New CLI arguments available
2. **Check SOURCE configurations**: Verify localhost support for your services
3. **Update hosts file**: Run `./start.sh --setup-hosts` for *.localhost domains
4. **Review Kong routes**: Routes now generated dynamically

**Optional Improvements:**
- Install UV package manager for better dependency management
- Use new CLI SOURCE overrides for easier configuration
- Leverage new troubleshooting documentation

**Breaking Changes:**
- Static `kong.yml` files no longer used (automatically migrated)
- Some services no longer support localhost SOURCE (see documentation)
- `generate_supabase_keys.sh` moved to `bootstrapper/` directory

### Compatibility Notes

- **Environment files**: Existing `.env` files remain compatible
- **Data volumes**: All data preserved across updates
- **Service APIs**: No changes to service endpoints or functionality
- **Docker images**: Updated but backward compatible
