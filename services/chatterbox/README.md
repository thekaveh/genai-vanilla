# Chatterbox (TTS engine)

Chatterbox is one of the TTS engines selectable via `TTS_PROVIDER_SOURCE`. It is
documented under the **TTS Provider** aggregator rather than as a standalone
service, because the user-facing role is "pick a TTS engine" — not "pick
Chatterbox":

→ See [services/tts-provider/README.md](../tts-provider/README.md) for the full
user-facing description, source-variant table, and configuration reference.

## Engine quick reference

- **Image:** `travisvn/chatterbox-tts-api:gpu` (GPU only; voice-cloning model)
- **License:** MIT (Resemble AI)
- **Activation:** `TTS_PROVIDER_SOURCE=chatterbox-container-gpu` (or
  `chatterbox-localhost` for a host-installed instance)
- **In-container port:** 4123
- **Host port:** `${CHATTERBOX_PORT}` (computed from `BASE_PORT` by the
  bootstrapper)

The manifest (`service.yml`) and compose fragment (`compose.yml`) in this folder
are the bootstrapper's source of truth for those values; treat this README as a
pointer, not a duplicate of the aggregator doc.
