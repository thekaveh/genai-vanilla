"""Check docker-compose hard dependencies against SOURCE-replaceable services.

Compose `depends_on` is only safe for services that must always be started as
containers. SOURCE-replaceable services can be `localhost`, `external`, or
`disabled`, so consumers should reference them through endpoint environment
variables and runtime readiness/feature checks instead of static `depends_on`.

Zero-arg checker. Invoke as ``python scripts/check-compose-source-deps.py``.

Exit codes:
    0  — all PASS
    1  — at least one FAIL line printed
    2  — internal failure (PyYAML missing, or docker compose config
         errored with stderr surfaced)

    delegate to `docker compose config` which renders the merged shape.
