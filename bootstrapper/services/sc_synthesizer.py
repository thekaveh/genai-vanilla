"""
Synthesize the legacy bootstrapper/service-configs.yml dict shape from manifests.

The bootstrapper used to load `bootstrapper/service-configs.yml` directly. After
the configuration-modularization refactor, each manifest at
`services/<name>/service.yml` owns its per-service slice of that data under
`runtime_sc:`, `runtime_adaptive:`, and `runtime_deps:` blocks (plus the
globals manifest owns the `runtime_dependency_tiers:` block).

`synthesize_legacy(manifests)` concatenates those slices into the exact same
dict shape consumers (`service_config.py`, `source_validator.py`,
`dependency_manager.py`, `ui/state_builder.py`, `wizard/llm_steps.py`) expect.
The legacy YAML file is now deleted; this function is the operational source.

Drift between sources.options[].effects and runtime_sc.<key>.<source>.environment
is intentionally NOT enforced — the runtime_sc block is authoritative for the
bootstrapper, while the sources block is documentation for the wizard. A future
follow-up may unify them.
