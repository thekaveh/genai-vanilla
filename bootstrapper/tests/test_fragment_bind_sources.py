"""Static guards against fragment bind-mount path bug classes:

1. `services/<X>/services/<Y>/` doubled paths — Compose v2's `include:`
   resolves relative paths in an included fragment from the fragment's
   own directory, so a fragment at `services/<X>/compose.yml` that
   writes `./services/<X>/foo` (or `./services/<Y>/foo` from a typo /
   copy-paste between sibling fragments) silently produces a doubled
   path. PR #29 shipped exactly this for prometheus + grafana.

2. Bind sources that escape `REPO_ROOT` — a `../../../etc/...` source
   would silently bind-mount an arbitrary host path into a container,
   a security-relevant class of regression no current test catches.

Compose v2's `include:` directive resolves relative paths from the
fragment's own directory, not the parent compose file. PR #29's bug:
a fragment at `services/<X>/compose.yml` writing `./services/<X>/config/foo`
resolved to `services/<X>/services/<X>/config/foo`; Docker auto-created
the missing source as a *directory* on first launch, and the SECOND
launch failed with `not a directory` because the mount target expected
a file. `test_fragment_equivalence.py` couldn't catch it because the
committed baseline contained the same doubled paths.

The structural pattern `services/[^/]+/services/[^/]+/` is fundamentally
never correct, regardless of whether the inner and outer service names
match (a copy-paste between sibling fragments would not be a self-double
but would be just as broken).

The checks here are static (no Docker daemon) so they live in the
regular unit-test CI job and stay independent of any baseline — a buggy
fragment cannot pass by accidentally matching a buggy fixture.

Why not check that every resolved path *exists* on disk? Several
fragments legitimately mount runtime-generated paths that aren't on disk
in a fresh checkout (litellm's `volumes/litellm/config.yaml`, neo4j's
`build/snapshot`, supabase's `db/snapshot`, kong's
`volumes/api/kong-dynamic.yml`). An existence check produces false
positives for those without catching anything the structural checks
miss for either bug class above.
