"""
Unit tests for the per-leaf ``[pulled]`` / ``[library]`` status badge
rendered under an expanded Ollama-family parent in the wizard.

Before the fix, ``_leaf_render_data`` ran inherited badges through
``_inherited_leaf_badges`` which strips status tags under the comment
*"every leaf of a [library] parent is library; the user already sees
that on the parent right above"*. That assumption is wrong: a family
like ``qwen3.6`` whose host has ``qwen3.6:35b-a3b-coding-mxfp8``
pulled but not ``qwen3.6:27b``/``35b``/etc. has mixed-status leaves.
The fix added a per-leaf status computation that consults
``opt.pulled_variants`` directly.

These tests exercise ``_leaf_render_data`` on a stub ``PromptPanel``
instance — the method only reads ``self._variant_cache`` and the
inputs we pass, so we don't need a full Textual app context. The same
behaviour is verified end-to-end against a live host Ollama in
``test_live_catalog_sync.py``.
