"""Generated secrets must never start with `-` or `_`, and consumers
of those secrets must use argparse-safe `--flag=VALUE` form.

The trap: `secrets.token_urlsafe()` emits `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, so ~3% of
values start with `-` or `_`. Init scripts then call argparse-style
CLIs (e.g. `airflow users create --password ${PASS}`); argparse sees
the leading `-` on the secret value and rejects with
`argument -p: expected one argument` because it thinks the value is
another flag.

This was observed live on a user launch the morning after PR #35
merged: a generated `AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` whose first character was
a literal `-` made airflow-init exit rc=1 → the whole airflow family
failed to start. (The original docstring quoted the offending token
verbatim, which is why GitGuardian flagged this file as a generic-
secret leak — it had already been rotated locally, but the literal in
git history was the actual problem. Don't quote generated secrets in
test docstrings even after rotation.) Two layers of defense:

1. **bootstrapper-side guard**: `_cli_safe_token_urlsafe()` re-rolls
   the token if the first char is `-` or `_`. No future generated
   secret can hit this CLI-parsing class.
2. **consumer-side defense**: init-airflow.sh uses the equals form of
   every flag (single-token binding) which argparse always parses as
   one argument even if VALUE starts with `-`.

Both layers are independent — either alone would have prevented the
crash. Together they're belt-and-suspenders.
