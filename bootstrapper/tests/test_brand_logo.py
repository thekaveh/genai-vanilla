"""Unit tests for utils.brand_logo — the BRAND_LOGO_FILE override + ATLAS fallback.

The block-art lockup is brand-overridable via BRAND_LOGO_FILE (same BRAND_*
rebranding contract as the name/tagline/credits). resolve() is a pure function
of the env (and the file it points at), so these tests are .env-independent.
