"""Programmatic prompt builder for Phase B research subagents.

`build_research_prompt(doc_folder)` returns a self-contained prompt string
that the Phase B controller passes to an Explore subagent. The prompt:

  - names the target doc folder + the manifests it aggregates
  - lists the other 20 doc folders with category + one-line description
  - lists the target's current upstream dependencies as a "do not propose
    these" set (the subagent must research GAPS, not re-derive what's wired)
  - cites the strict row-file + candidate schemas
  - states the WebFetch budget (8 fetches) and hard caps (800 words, 5
    candidates)
  - directs output to docs/research/rows/<doc_folder>.md

All data is pulled from manifests + topology so the prompt is current.

Your job is to research **integration opportunities** for this service and produce a single markdown file at `docs/research/rows/{doc_folder}.md` following the strict schema below.

## Scope

Three research deliverables, in order:

1. **Missing-pair integrations** — pairs of services ALREADY IN the stack that should be wired together but aren't. For each candidate pair, the bullet must include: *Why valuable*, *Mechanism sketch* (named endpoint or protocol), *Effort* (small | medium | large), *Risks / open questions*, *Confidence* (high | medium | low). Confidence must be backed by an entry in `sources_consulted`.

2. **Candidate new services** — services NOT currently in the stack that would plug in cleanly here. Maximum **5 candidates per row file**. For each, write a full one-pager at `docs/research/candidates/<slug>.md` per the candidate schema below — UNLESS a one-pager already exists, in which case append a `## Cross-references` line to your row pointing at the existing file.

3. **Per-service feature gaps** — capabilities the upstream project ({doc_folder}) exposes that we don't yet leverage in this stack.

## Target context

- **Doc folder:** `{doc_folder}`
- **Existing manifest(s):** `services/{primary_manifest}/service.yml`{member_note}
- **Existing doc:** `services/{doc_folder}/README.md`

## Do NOT propose these (already wired)

The following services are already connected to {doc_folder} via the manifest's `depends_on.required`, `runtime_adaptive.adapts_to`, or `runtime_deps.optional`. Do not propose new wiring with these — your job is to find GAPS, not duplicate existing edges.

{dnp_block}

## Other services in the stack

These are the 20 other doc folders. Each pair (`{doc_folder}` × <other>) is a candidate for "missing-pair integration" if not already wired.

{others_table}

## Row file schema (write this to `docs/research/rows/{doc_folder}.md`)

The file MUST begin with a YAML frontmatter block (the `---` fenced header below) and contain exactly the three numbered sections shown.

```markdown
---
service: {doc_folder}
category: <one of: infra | data | llm | media | agents | apps>
generated: 2026-05-18
generator: phase-b-subagent
sources_consulted:
  - https://...                # upstream docs/repo
  - services/{doc_folder}/service.yml
  - services/{doc_folder}/README.md
  - ...
---

# {doc_folder} — Integration Research

## 1. Missing-pair integrations

- **{doc_folder} ↔ <Other>**
  - Why valuable: <1-2 sentences>
  - Mechanism sketch: <named endpoint or protocol — e.g. `bolt://neo4j:7687`>
  - Effort: small | medium | large
  - Risks / open questions: <bullets, may be empty>
  - Confidence: high | medium | low

(or `_No high-confidence opportunities identified._` if nothing meets the bar)

## 2. Candidate new services

- **<Candidate Name>** → `../candidates/<slug>.md`
  - Headline: <one sentence>
  - Other consumers in stack: <bulleted services>

## 3. Per-service feature gaps

- **<feature>** — Why pursue: <reason>. Effort: <small|medium|large>.
```

## Candidate one-pager schema (write to `docs/research/candidates/<slug>.md`)

If a one-pager already exists at that path, do NOT overwrite it — instead, append a `## Cross-references` line to it linking from your row. The merge step will reconcile `referenced-by:` later.

```markdown
---
slug: <kebab-case>
name: <Display Name>
type: external-service
category-fit: <one of: infra | data | llm | media | agents | apps>
generated: 2026-05-18
upstream: <URL>
license: <SPDX or "unknown">
referenced-by: [{doc_folder}]
---

# <Name>

## Headline
<one sentence>

## Problem it solves
<2-3 sentences>

## Stack wiring sketch
- <service A> → <this candidate> via <protocol/endpoint>
- <this candidate> → <service B> via <...>

(Every bullet MUST name a real service in the current topology.)

## Effort
<small | medium | large> — <one sentence on what dominates the cost>

## Risks & open questions
- <bullet> (may be empty but heading is required)

## Why now (and why not sooner)
<optional, one paragraph>

## Upstream evidence
<at least one URL>
```

## Hard caps

- **800 words** total per row file.
- **5 candidates** maximum per row file. Rank and trim if you have more.
- **WebFetch budget: 8** for this subagent. Use them on upstream project docs for high-confidence claims.

## Quality bar

**Good output:**
- "**hermes ↔ neo4j** — Why: persistent agent memory across sessions. Mechanism: skill writing session graphs via `bolt://neo4j:7687`. Effort: medium. Confidence: medium (Hermes skill system supports custom tools per https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes/blob/main/docs/skills.md)."

**Bad output:**
- "Could maybe use neo4j somehow." (vague, no mechanism, no confidence reason)
- Naming a service that doesn't exist in the topology table above.
- Re-proposing a pair already in the "Do NOT propose" list.

## Process

1. Read `services/{primary_manifest}/service.yml`, the existing README at `services/{doc_folder}/README.md`, and any init scripts.
2. Identify the strongest 3-7 missing-pair integration candidates from the other-20-services table.
3. Identify 0-5 candidate new services that would slot in cleanly.
4. Identify 0-N per-service feature gaps from upstream docs.
5. Write the row file at the path above following the schema EXACTLY.
6. For each candidate, write the one-pager (or append `## Cross-references` if it exists).
7. Validate yourself: run `python scripts/validate_research_schema.py docs/research/rows/{doc_folder}.md` from the repo root. Exit 0 = pass.

## When you are done

Report:
- **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
- The row-file path you wrote.
- The candidate-file paths you created (and which you cross-referenced instead of created).
- Validator exit code.
- Word count of the row file body.

Do NOT modify code under `bootstrapper/` or `services/`. Do NOT touch other doc folders or other row/candidate files. Stay within your `docs/research/rows/{doc_folder}.md` and the candidate files you author.
