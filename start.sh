# GenAI Vanilla Stack - Start Script Wrapper

# This is a thin wrapper that calls the Python implementation for full cross-platform compatibility.

# Refuse to run as root. The wizard runs entirely as the invoking user;
# only --setup-hosts touches /etc/hosts, and that step shells out to
# sudo internally for the single privileged write. Running the whole
# script under sudo creates root-owned files (.venv, volumes/api/
# kong-dynamic.yml, __pycache__) the next non-sudo run can't overwrite
# — a silent footgun. Fail fast instead.
# See docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md for recovery if you've already hit this.
